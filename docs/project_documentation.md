# Project Documentation

## Summary

This project will be made as a portfolio showcase my my python skills to explore an issue that I am passionate about: the public health impact of over policing and missalocation of funds used for law enforcement at the expense of budgets that work for their communities.

## Objectives

1. generate a clean dataset of community level government budget allocations spent on law enforement as absolute values and proportions of the overall budget.

2. generate a clean dataset of community level population health indicators and outcome metrics.

3. successfully showcase python coding by combinng, processing, and analyzing combined dataset of budget and health outcome relationships.

## Scope

- Data will be limited to the United States, and the last 25 years, if data are aavailable.
- Data granularity and criteria are yet to be determined.

## Expected Outcomes and Outputs

- This project will ideally generate a dataset, statistical analysis python script, scrapping scripts for data sources, and visualizations of the findings.
